# Schwinger Model Project

This repository contains work from Marina’s original repository (https://github.com/mmaneyro/Schwinger_model), with additional testing and development in the `Schwinger_model_testing.ipynb` notebook. The purpose of this fork is to troubleshoot and understand recent changes.

## Notebooks

- **Schwinger_model.ipynb**: The latest version, (https://github.com/mmaneyro/Schwinger_model) which serve as the foundation.
- **Schwinger_model_testing.ipynb**: Contains my version where I’m testing and running code.

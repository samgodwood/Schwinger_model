This branch includes updates to integrate Marina’s ((https://github.com/mmaneyro/Schwinger_model)) latest code alongside my version (`Schwinger_model_testing.ipynb`) to test and play around. The purpose of this branch is to troubleshoot and understand recent changes.

- `Schwinger_model_testing.ipynb`: Contains my version where I’m testing and running code.
- `Schwinger_model.ipynb`: Marina’s latest version with recent updates (https://github.com/mmaneyro/Schwinger_model).
